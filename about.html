	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Puget Sound QGIS User Group was formed by students in a QGIS class, excited about
	   the power and flexibility of QGIS as desktop software free from the constraints of
	   commercial software licensing costs.
	</p>
	<p>The ready availability of QGIS combined with open data can put mapping power in the
	   hands of anyone with a computer and desire to learn. At PSQGIS we intend to provide
	   mutual support and opportunity to share what you have already learned.
