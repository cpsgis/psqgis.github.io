[Our Regular Monthly Meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/230571258/)
-----------------------------

### Tuesday May 10th, 6 - 8pm

King Street Center
[201 South Jackson Street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.59885/-122.33041)

Although the building will be locked at the meeting time, we'll have someone stationed outside to let you in. If you arrive late, call me (Stu) at 360-951-5131 and we'll come outside and let you in the building.

Hello!

Here's the agenda for this upcoming meeting:

* We're going to create a reference list of QGIS tools and methods and their ArcGIS software equivalents.  For example, if I know how to do a polygon buffer in Arc, this list will provide the QGIS equivalent.  We'd like to eventually assemble a comprehensive collection of QGIS tools organized by category (cartography, analysis, data management..).  This list will be very useful for not only new QGIS users, but  for those of us who are transitioning from Arc software.  So... bring your favorite QGIS tool or technique and (if you know it) the Arc equivalent.  A tip of the hat to Peter Keum for this idea! 
* Clifford Snow is going to share his Open Street Map (OSM) expertise with us.  He has generously offered to show us how to extract and download (free!) GIS data from OSM and bring it into QGIS for analysis and display.
* Joel Masselink and I will show how to create and display time-dependent data, including output videos, in QGIS using GPS source data.

This should be an interesting and informative meeting, and I'm looking forward to seeing all of you!
