[Our Regular Monthly Meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/230151764/)
-----------------------------

King Street Center
[201 South Jackson Street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.59885/-122.33041)

The building is locked in the evening. After the main enterance is gated you can access the building from a small side door facing 2nd Avenue South close to South Jackson Street. Paul McCombs will be at the door to help people in.

For this meeting, we're going to have an open session on web mapping with QGIS. If time allows, I'll be talking about Geopackages and Spatialite, the QGIS Time Manager plugin, and the Qfield smartphone app.
