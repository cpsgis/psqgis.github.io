[Our Regular Monthly Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/233220264/)
-----------------------------

### Tuesday August 9th, 6-8pm

My apologies for not getting this message out sooner. We'll meet at:

[Richmond Beach Library, 19601 21st Ave. NW, Shoreline, WA](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.77189&mlon=-122.38504#map=19/47.77189/-122.38504)

We'll continue our integration work from last month, and Peter Keum will review the latest QGIS book. See you there!
