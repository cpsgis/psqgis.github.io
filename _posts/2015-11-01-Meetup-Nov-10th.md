Library meeting room


Hello Fellow PSQGIS members.

I'm happy to announce our [upcoming monthly meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/226389306/), Tuesday, November 10th, from 6:30 - 8:30 pm.  This time, we're going to move the venue to the South Sound area, at the Lakewood public library, [6300 Wildaire Rd SW, Lakewood, WA](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/377915619#map=19/47.16035/-122.52144) in the Library meeting room.  Hopefully this location will give people who have had a difficult time traveling north to Seattle for our previous meetings the chance to join in.  

I think the agenda will be pretty informative, with solid, practical tips for using QGIS.  John Murphy will demonstrate how to create output maps, including paper and digital, using the Print Composer.  Paul McCombs will have advice on how to link tables together in a 1:many fashion using Relates.  I've got some quick tips on accessing free (!) basemaps, using coordinate systems within QGIS, and adding Google Earth .kml files to QGIS.

As always, there will be time for your questions, suggestions and all other ideas related to QGIS.  

Paul McCombs was kind enough to take notes from our previous meeting, and he's posted them, along with all of our other meeting notes, at the [PSQGIS Blog](http://psqgis.org/blog/).

I look forward to seeing all of you!

Stu Smith
