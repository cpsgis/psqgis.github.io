[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is a great source of [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) that you can [download](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Downloading_data) and use in QGIS.
Their annual US conference, [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/), is going to be held in Seattle this year. The early bird discount ends April 10th. I've included the announcement below.
