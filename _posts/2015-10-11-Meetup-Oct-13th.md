Hello, fellow PSQGIS-ers! This is to confirm our [next meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/225737513/), which will be held this coming Tuesday, October 13, from 6:30 - 8:30 pm at the [Richmond Beach Library, 19601 21st Ave. NW, Shoreline, WA](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/35899251#map=19/47.77187/-122.38504).

There are a number of QGIS-related topics for us to cover:

1. Using coordinate systems and projections within QGIS
2. How to add raster data, create a hillshade, and then blend colors between multiple layers (such as hillshade overlays)
3. How to join attribute tables in QGIS
4. Adding well-known-text (.wkt) data to QGIS
5. Further information on displaying time-related data in the QGIS Time Manager plugin
6. Adding Google Earth .kml files to QGIS
7. A special surprise topic!

As always, there will be time for QGIS-related general discussion, questions, tips and tricks.

Regards, Stu
