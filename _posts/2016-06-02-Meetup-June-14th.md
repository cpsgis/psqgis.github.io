[Our Regular Monthly Meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/231356815/)
-----------------------------

### Tuesday June 14th, 6 - 8pm

Shoreline Library

[345 NE 175th Street](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.75560&mlon=-122.32504#map=18/47.75560/-122.32504) *in the small meeting room*

I'm looking forward to seeing all of you for our upcoming monthly meeting.  We've got a great lineup planned.  Scott Le is going to share the Lecos ([Landscape Ecology Statistics](https://conservationecology.wordpress.com/qgis-plugins-and-scripts/lecos-land-cover-statistics/)) QGIS plugin with us - using geographic data from Senegal.  Andrew McAninch will cover a variety of issues including fixing geometry errors, terrain analysis and the modeler.  We'll also have a group discussion comparing the pros and cons of Spatialite and Geopackage spatial databases.  As if that weren't all we'll continue with our regular monthly comparison of QGIS and Arc tools, so please feel free to share with the group any QGIS tool and its Arc equivalent.  See you at the Shoreline Library!
