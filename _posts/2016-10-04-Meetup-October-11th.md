### We have a table reserved under my name: Stu Smith

Hello All,

We'll meet at Schultzy's Sausage, 4114 University Way NE in Seattle, on October 11th, from 6-8 pm.

Andrew has developed a number of QGIS custom data entry forms, so this will be valuable to see. 

Peter has been looking at a new QGIS user book, and will give us a review.

I've got two QGIS plugins to share: an automatic attribute field updater and a raster cell calculator. 

Plus beer and brats!  See you there!
