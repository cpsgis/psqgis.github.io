[Our Regular Monthly Meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/228600890/)
-----------------------------

Bellevue Regional Library Room 1

[1111 110th AVE NE, Bellevue, WA](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/47.62005/-122.19424)

We'll have another information-packed session at this meeting. John Murphy will demonstrate how to print multi-paged atlases and Bob Catherman will give the second part of his raster experiment using QGIS. Stu Smith will show how to package a QGIS project and all of it's associated data into a single zipped file which can be shared with others.  

Don't forget that Paul McCombs has been kind enough to keep our meeting notes.  He's placed them at our web site, and you can view them at [http://psqgis.org/blog/](/blog/). 

I hope to see you Tuesday!  Stu
