## [Our Monthly Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Puget-Sound-QGIS-Users-Group/events/233474292)

## Tuesday September 13th, 6-8pm

[Lake Forest Bar & Grill, 17535 Ballinger Way Ne, Seattle, WA](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.75535&mlon=-122.28044#map=17/47.75535/-122.28044)

### A table has been reserved for us.

Hello! At our last meeting, we agreed to hold a more socially-oriented event at our next meeting, so please plan to meet this time for refreshments and/or dinner!

Although QGIS will be the evening's theme, this will be primarily be a dinner-time chance to get to know each other better and share ideas and experiences at a more relaxed and informal level.

Please feel free to bring a laptop, as the restaurant has wifi. Since we'll be seated at a table, we won't have an overhead monitor. However, we can always look over each other's shoulders at a laptop display!

As always, if you have a QGIS question or topic to share, please bring it along. Alternatively, if you're more in the mood for dinner and a brew, that can be accomplished as well! I look forward to seeing all of you.
